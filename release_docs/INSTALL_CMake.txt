========================================================================
I. Preconditions
========================================================================
Obtaining HDF5 source code
   1. Create a directory for your development; for example, "myhdfstuff".

   2. Obtain HDF5 source from Github
         development branch:  https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5
         last release:        https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/releases/latest
             hdf5-2_"X"_"Y".tar.gz or hdf5-2_"X"_"Y".zip

      and put it in "myhdfstuff".
      Uncompress the file. There should be a hdf5-2."X"."Y" folder.

   3. Obtain HDF5 plugin source from Github
         development branch:  https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5_plugins
      Or let the CMake build process download the plugins for you with
      the following options:
         HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="GIT"(or "TGZ")
         HDF5_ENABLE_PLUGIN_SUPPORT:BOOL=ON

CMake version
   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake from the Kitware web site.
      The HDF5 2."X"."Y" product requires a minimum CMake version 3.26.

Note:
   To change the install prefix from the platform defaults initialize
   the CMake variable, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Users of build scripts
   will use the INSTALLDIR option.

Note:
   See the CMake documentation for more information on setting the
   logging levels:
       https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_MESSAGE_LOG_LEVEL.html


========================================================================
II. RECOMMENDED: Quick Start with CMake Presets
========================================================================

⭐ This is the RECOMMENDED method for building HDF5 2.0 and later.

Prerequisites
-------------
  - CMake 3.26 or later (required for HDF5 2.0)
  - Ninja build system (recommended, should be downloaded if not available)
  - Compiler: GCC, MSVC, or Clang

Quick Start (3 steps)
---------------------
1. Change to the HDF5 source directory:
       cd /path/to/hdf5-2.x.y

2. Execute a workflow preset:
       cmake --workflow --preset ci-StdShar-GNUC --fresh       # Linux/Mac with GCC
       cmake --workflow --preset ci-StdShar-MSVC --fresh       # Windows with MSVC
       cmake --workflow --preset ci-StdShar-Clang --fresh      # Linux/Mac with Clang

3. Find your build artifacts in:
       ../build/ci-StdShar-<compiler>/

That's it! The workflow preset automatically:
  - Configures the build
  - Compiles libraries and tools
  - Runs tests
  - Creates installation packages

Available Presets
-----------------
View all available presets:
    cmake --list-presets

Common presets:
  Standard Builds:
    ci-StdShar-GNUC        Standard shared libraries (GCC)
    ci-StdShar-MSVC        Standard shared libraries (MSVC)
    ci-StdShar-Clang       Standard shared libraries (Clang)
    ci-MinShar-GNUC        Minimal shared libraries (GCC)

  Java Builds:
    ci-StdShar-GNUC-Java-FFM     Java FFM bindings (GCC)
    ci-StdShar-GNUC-Java-JNI     Java JNI bindings (GCC)

  Maven Deployment (JNI default - Java 8+):
    ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-Snapshot               JNI snapshots for Maven
    ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven                        JNI release for Maven

  Maven Deployment (FFM optional - Java 25+):
    ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-FFM-Snapshot           FFM snapshots for Maven
    ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-FFM                    FFM release for Maven

  Note: For ROS3 (S3 support), add -DHDF5_ENABLE_ROS3_VFD=ON to any preset

See Section XI for creating custom preset configurations.

Why Use Presets?
----------------
✅ Simpler - No external files to download
✅ Faster - Optimized settings included
✅ Consistent - Same settings across platforms
✅ Modern - CMake 3.26 best practices
✅ Flexible - Easy to customize via CMakeUserPresets.json

Individual Preset Commands (Advanced)
--------------------------------------
If you prefer to run preset steps individually (where <compiler-type> is GNUC, MSVC, or Clang):

    cd /path/to/hdf5-source
    cmake --preset ci-StdShar-<compiler-type>        # Configure
    cmake --build --preset ci-StdShar-<compiler-type> # Build
    ctest --preset ci-StdShar-<compiler-type>        # Test
    cpack --preset ci-StdShar-<compiler-type>        # Package

The workflow preset (shown in Quick Start above) runs all these steps automatically.

Advanced Build Methods
---------------------
If you cannot use presets or need more control, see:
  - Section III: Building with CMake Script Mode (requires external files, for automation/CI)
  - Section IV: Building with CMake Command Mode (manual configuration, for advanced users)


========================================================================
III. Advanced: Building HDF5 Libraries with CMake Script Mode
========================================================================

NOTE: Most users should use Section II (CMake Presets) instead.
      This method is provided for advanced users and automated builds.

This short set of instructions is written for users who want to quickly
build the HDF5 C, C++ and Fortran shared libraries and tools
from the HDF5 source code package using the CMake tools. This procedure
will use the default settings in the config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file.
The HDF Group recommends using the presets process to build HDF5.

NOTE: When using the presets process, the CMakePresets.json file in the source
    directory will configure, build, test, and package HDF5 with the same options
    that are set in the cacheinit.cmake file.
    In addition, it will get the optional files listed below that are needed, from
    the appropriate repositories.
    See Section II: RECOMMENDED Quick Start with CMake Presets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Individual files needed as mentioned in this document
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download from https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5/blob/develop/config/cmake/scripts:
    CTestScript.cmake  -- CMake build script

    HDF5config.cmake   -- CMake configuration script
    HDF5options.cmake  -- CMake configuration options script

External compression plugin libraries from https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5_plugins:
    hdf5_plugins.tar.gz

External compression szip and zlib libraries:
    ZLIB          "https://github.com/madler/zlib/releases/download/v1.3.1/zlib-1.3.1.tar.gz"
    ZLIBNG        "https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng/archive/refs/tags/2.2.4.tar.gz"
    LIBAEC        "https://github.com/MathisRosenhauer/libaec/releases/download/v1.1.3/libaec-1.1.3.tar.gz"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build scripts for windows or linux
-----------------------------------------------

To build HDF5 with the SZIP and ZLIB external libraries you will need to:

   1. Change to the development directory "myhdfstuff".

   2. Download/copy the individual files mentioned above to "myhdfstuff".
      Do not uncompress the tar.gz files.

   3. Change to the source directory "hdf5-2.x.y".
      CTestScript.cmake file should not be modified.

   4. Edit the platform configuration file, HDF5options.cmake, if you want to change
      the default build environment. The file is a compilation of the most used
      options and by commenting/uncommenting lines the options can easily be changed.

   5. From the "myhdfstuff" directory execute the CTest Script with the
      following options:

      On 32-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2022, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS2022 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On 64-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2022, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS202264 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On 32-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2019, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS2019 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On 64-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2019, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS201964 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On 32-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2017, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS2017 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On 64-bit Windows with Visual Studio 2017, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=VS201764 -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      On Linux and Mac, execute:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,BUILD_GENERATOR=Unix -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log
      The supplied build scripts are versions of the above.

      The command above will configure, build, test, and create an install
      package in the myhdfstuff folder. It will have the format:
          HDF5-2.X.Y-<platform>.<zip or tar.gz>

          On Unix, <platform> will be "Linux". A similar .sh file will also be created.
          On Windows, <platform> will be "win64" or "win32". If you have an
          installer on your system, you will also see a similar file that ends
          in either .exe (NSIS) or .msi (WiX).

      Notes on the command line options.
          The -S option uses the script version of ctest.

          The value for the -C option (as shown above, "-C Release") must
          match the setting for CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE in the platform
          configuration file.

          The -VV option is for most verbose; use -V for less verbose.

          The "-O hdf5.log" option saves the output to a log file hdf5.log.

   6. To install, "X" is the current release version

      On Windows (with WiX installed), execute:
                HDF5-2."X"."Y"-win32.msi or HDF5-2."X"."Y"-win64.msi
      By default this program will install the hdf5 library into the
      "C:\Program Files" directory and will create the following
      directory structure:
         HDF_Group
         --HDF5
         ----2."X"."Y"
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------lib
         --------plugin
         ------cmake

      On Linux, change to the install destination directory
      (create it if doesn't exist) and execute:
                <path-to>/myhdfstuff/HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux.sh
      After accepting the license, the script will prompt:
        By default the HDF5 will be installed in:
        "<current directory>/HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux"
        Do you want to include the subdirectory HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux?
        Saying no will install in: "<current directory>" [Yn]:
      Note that the script will create the following directory structure
      relative to the install point:
         HDF_Group
         --HDF5
         ----2."X"."Y"
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------lib
         --------plugin
         ------share

      On Mac you will find HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Darwin.dmg in the myhdfstuff folder. Click
      on the dmg file to proceed with installation. After accepting the license,
      there will be a folder with the following structure:
         HDF_Group
         --HDF5
         ----2."X"."Y"
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------lib
         --------plugin
         ------share

      By default the installation will create the bin, include, lib and cmake
      folders in the <install destination directory>/HDF_Group/HDF5/2."X"."Y"
      The <install destination directory> depends on the build platform;
        Windows will set the default to:
          C:/Program Files/HDF_Group/HDF5/2."X"."Y"
        Linux will set the default to:
          "myhdfstuff/HDF_Group/HDF5/2."X"."Y"
      The default can be changed by adding ",INSTALLDIR=<my new dir>" to the
      "ctest -S HDF5config.cmake..." command. For example on linux:
         ctest -S HDF5config.cmake,INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/myhdf5,BUILD_GENERATOR=Unix -C Release -VV -O hdf5.log


========================================================================
IV. Advanced: Building HDF5 Libraries with CMake Command Mode
========================================================================

NOTE: Most users should use Section II (CMake Presets) instead.
      This method is provided for advanced users who need manual control.

Notes: This short set of instructions is written for users who want to
       quickly build just the HDF5 C static library and tools from
       the HDF5 source code package using the CMake command line tools.
       Avoid the use of drive letters in paths on Windows.

   Go through these steps:

      1. Change to the development directory "myhdfstuff".

      2. Uncompress the HDF5 source file

      3. Create a folder  "build" in the "myhdfstuff" directory.

      4. Change into the "build" folder.

      5. Configure the C library, tools and tests with one of the following commands:

         On Windows 32 bit
           cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_BUILD_TOOLS:BOOL=ON ..\hdf5-2."X"."Y"

         On Windows 64 bit
           cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_BUILD_TOOLS:BOOL=ON ..\hdf5-2."X"."Y"

         On Linux and Mac
           cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_BUILD_TOOLS:BOOL=ON ../hdf5-2."X"."Y"

         where "X" is the current release version.

      6. Build the C library, tools and tests with this command:
           cmake --build . --config Release

      7. Test the C library and tools with this command:
           ctest . -C Release

      8. Create an install image with this command:
           cpack -C Release CPackConfig.cmake

      9. To install
         On Windows (with WiX installed), execute:
                HDF5-2."X"."Y"-win32.msi or HDF5-2."X"."Y"-win64.msi
         By default this program will install the hdf5 library into the
         "C:\Program Files" directory and will create the following
         directory structure:
            HDF_Group
            --HDF5
            ----2."X"."Y"
            ------bin
            ------include
            ------lib
            --------plugin
            ------cmake

         On Linux, change to the install destination directory
         (create if doesn't exist) and execute:
                <path-to>/myhdfstuff/build/HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux.sh
         After accepting the license, the script will prompt:
           By default the HDF5 will be installed in:
           "<current directory>/HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux"
           Do you want to include the subdirectory HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Linux?
           Saying no will install in: "<current directory>" [Yn]:
         Note that the script will create the following directory structure
         relative to the install point:
            HDF_Group
            --HDF5
            ----2."X"."Y"
            ------bin
            ------include
            ------lib
            --------plugin
            ------share

         On Mac you will find HDF5-2."X"."Y"-Darwin.dmg in the build folder. Click
         on the dmg file to proceed with installation. After accepting the license,
         there will be a folder with the following structure:
            HDF_Group
            --HDF5
            ----2."X"."Y"
            ------bin
            ------include
            ------lib
            --------plugin
            ------share


========================================================================
IV. Further Considerations
========================================================================

   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake from the Kitware
      web site. The HDF5 2."X"."Y" product requires a minimum CMake version 3.26.

   2. If you plan to use Zlib or Szip (aka libaec):
      A. Download the binary packages and install them in a central location.
         For example on Windows, create a folder extlibs and install the
         packages there. Add the following CMake options:
            -DZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/zlib.lib
            -DZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DZLIB_USE_EXTERNAL:BOOL=OFF
            -DSZIP_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/libszaec.lib
            -DSZIP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -Dlibaec_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=some_location/lib/libaec.lib
            -Dlibaec_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=some_location/include
            -DSZIP_USE_EXTERNAL:BOOL=OFF
         where "some_location" is the full path to the extlibs folder.
         Also if the appropriate environment variable is set, the above options are not required;
            set(ENV{ZLIB_ROOT} "some_location")
            set(ENV{SZIP_ROOT} "some_location")
            set(ENV{libaec_ROOT} "some_location")

        Note that if there is a problem finding the libraries, try adding the
        CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE:BOOL=ON to the command line.

      B. Use source packages from an GIT server by adding the following CMake
         options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="GIT"
            ZLIB_GIT_URL:STRING="https://some_location/zlib" or ZLIBNG_GIT_URL:STRING="https://some_location/zlibng"
            ZLIB_GIT_BRANCH="some_branch" or ZLIBNG_GIT_BRANCH="some_branch"
            SZIP_GIT_URL:STRING="https://some_location/szip"
            SZIP_GIT_BRANCH="some_branch"
            LIBAEC_GIT_URL:STRING="https://some_location/libaec"
            LIBAEC_GIT_BRANCH="some_branch"
         where "some_location" is the URL to the GIT repository and "some_branch" is
         a branch in the repository, usually the default. Also set
         CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to the configuration type.

      C. Use source packages from a compressed file by adding the following
         CMake options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
            ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext" or ZLIBNG_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlibng_src.ext"
            LIBAEC_TGZ_NAME:STRING="libaec_src.ext"
            TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
         where "some_location" is the URL or full path to the compressed
         file and ext is the type of compression file. Also set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
         to the configuration type during configuration. See the settings in the
         config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file HDF uses for testing.

      D. Use original source packages from a compressed file by adding the following
         CMake options:
            LIBAEC_TGZ_NAME:STRING="szip_src.ext"
            LIBAEC_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING="some_location"

            ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext" or ZLIBNG_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlibng_src.ext"
            ZLIB_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING="some_location" or ZLIBNG_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING="some_location"

            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
         where "some_location" is the URL and by setting
            ZLIB_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
            LIBAEC_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
         or full path to the compressed file and ext is the type of compression file.
         Also set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to the configuration type during configuration.
         See the settings in the config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file HDF uses for testing.

         The files can also be retrieved from a local path if necessary
            TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
         by setting
            ZLIB_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=ON
            LIBAEC_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=ON

   3. If you plan to use compression plugins:
      A. Use source packages from an GIT server by adding the following CMake
         options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="GIT"
            PLUGIN_GIT_URL:STRING="http://some_location/plugins"
            PLUGIN_GIT_BRANCH="some_branch"
         where "some_location" is the URL to the GIT repository and "some_branch" is
         a branch in the repository, usually the default. Also set
         CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to the configuration type.

      B. Use source packages from a compressed file by adding the following
         CMake options:
            HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"
            PLUGIN_TGZ_NAME:STRING="plugin_src.ext"
            TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
         where "some_location" is the URL or full path to the compressed
         file and ext is the type of compression file. Also set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
         to the configuration type during configuration. See the settings in the
         config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file HDF uses for testing.

   4. If you are building on Apple Darwin platforms, you should add the
      following options:
          Compiler choice - use xcode by setting the ENV variables of CC and CXX
          Shared fortran is not supported, build static:
            BUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=OFF
          Additional options:
            CMAKE_ANSI_CFLAGS:STRING=-fPIC
            CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=ON

   5. Windows developers should install NSIS or WiX to create an install image with CPack.
      Visual Studio Express users will not be able to package HDF5 into
      an install image executable.

   6. Developers can copy the config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file and alter the
      the settings for the developers' environment. Then the only options needed
      on the command line are those options that are different. Example using HDF
      default cache file:
           cmake -C ../config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" \
               -DHDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF -DHDF5_ENABLE_ZLIB_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF \
               -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..

   7. CMake uses a toolchain of utilities to compile, link libraries and
      create archives, and other tasks to drive the build. The toolchain
      utilities available are determined by the languages enabled. In normal
      builds, CMake automatically determines the toolchain for host builds
      based on system introspection and defaults. In cross-compiling
      scenarios, a toolchain file may be specified with information about
      compiler and utility paths.
                Variables and Properties
      Several variables relate to the language components of a toolchain which
      are enabled. CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER is the full path to the compiler used
      for <LANG>. CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID is the identifier used by CMake for
      the compiler and CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION is the version of the compiler.

      The CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS variables and the configuration-specific equivalents
      contain flags that will be added to the compile command when compiling a
      file of a particular language.

      As the linker is invoked by the compiler driver, CMake needs a way to
      determine which compiler to use to invoke the linker. This is calculated
      by the LANGUAGE of source files in the target, and in the case of static
      libraries, the language of the dependent libraries. The choice CMake makes
      may be overridden with the LINKER_LANGUAGE target property.

      See the CMake help for more information on using toolchain files.

      To use a toolchain file with the supplied cmake scripts, see the
      HDF5options.cmake file under the toolchain section.

Notes: CMake and HDF5

   1. CMake support for HDF5 development should be usable on any
      system where CMake is supported. Please send us any comments on
      how CMake support can be improved on any system. Visit the
      Kitware site for more information about CMake.

   2. Build and test results can be submitted to our HDF5 CDash server:
      The CDash server for community submissions of hdf5 is at
          https://my.cdash.org.

      We ask that all submissions include the configuration information and
      contact information in the CTest Notes Files upload step. See the
      current reports on CDash for examples.

      Please follow the convention that "NIGHTLY" submissions maintain the same
      configuration every time. "EXPERIMENTAL" submissions can be expected to
      be different for each submission.

   3. See the appendix at the bottom of this file for examples of using
      a ctest script for building and testing. Using a ctest script is
      preferred because of its flexibility.

Notes: CMake in General

   1. More information about using CMake can be found at the Kitware site at
         www.cmake.org.

   2. CMake uses the command line; however, the visual CMake tool is
      available for the configuration step. The steps are similar for
      all the operating systems supported by CMake.

   3. Setting the installation location from the command line at configure time
      a. Using the --install-prefix command line option, which is available since
         CMake version 3.21:
            cmake --install-prefix /my/folder/to/install/to ..
      b. Using -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX :
            cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/folder/to/install/to ..
      c. Using the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX environment variable, which is available
         since CMake version 3.29:
            CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/folder/to/install/to cmake ..

========================================================================
V. Options for Building HDF5 Libraries with the CMake Command Line
========================================================================

To build the HDF5 Libraries with CMake, go through these five steps:

   1. Run CMake
   2. Configure the cache settings
   3. Build HDF5
   4. Test HDF5
   5. Package HDF5 (create install image)

These five steps are described in detail below.

========================================================================

   1. Run CMake

      The visual CMake executable is named "cmake-gui.exe" on Windows and should be
      available in your Start menu. For Linux, UNIX, and Mac users the
      executable is named "cmake-gui" and can be found where CMake was
      installed.
      Another option is to use the presets file, CMakePresets.json, to configure,
      build, test, and package HDF5. See section X: Using CMakePresets.json for compiling
      for use of that file. You can create a CMakeUserPresets.json file to create a
      specific configuration for your environment. Note that Visual Studio and XCode can
      use the presets files.

      Specify the source and build directories.

      ***** Make the build and source directories different. ******

      For example on Windows, if the source is at c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5,
      then use c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build or c:\MyHDFstuff\build\hdf5 as the
      build directory.

      RECOMMENDED:
        Users can perform the configuration step without using the visual
        cmake-gui program. We use the file cacheinit.cmake in the
        config/cmake source folder for our testing. This file enables all of the
        basic options and we turn specific options on or off for testing
        using the following command line within the build directory:

        cmake -C <sourcepath>/config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "<generator>"  [-D<options>]  <sourcepath>

        Where <generator> is (examples):
            * MinGW Makefiles
            * NMake Makefiles
            * Unix Makefiles
            * Ninja
            * Visual Studio 15 2017
            * Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64
            * Visual Studio 16 2019
            * Visual Studio 17 2022

        <options> is:
          For installed SZIP/libaec:
              * SZIP_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to szip includes directory>
              * SZIP_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to szip/library file>
              * libaec_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to libaec includes directory>
              * libaec_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to libaec/library file>
            or
              * SZIP_ROOT:PATH=<path to szip root directory>
              * libaec_ROOT:PATH=<path to libaec root directory>
          For installed ZLIB/ZLIBNG:
              * ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=<path to zlib includes directory>
              * ZLIB_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=<path to zlib/library file>
            or
              * ZLIB_ROOT:PATH=<path to zlib root directory>

            * <HDF5OPTION>:BOOL=[ON | OFF]

        <cacheinit.cmake> highlights are:

            set (PLUGIN_GIT_BRANCH "master" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

   2. Configure the cache settings

      2.1  Visual CMake users, click the Configure button. If this is the first time you are
           running cmake-gui in this directory, you will be prompted for the
           generator you wish to use (for example on Windows, Visual Studio 14).
           CMake will read in the CMakeLists.txt files from the source directory and
           display options for the HDF5 project. After the first configure you
           can adjust the cache settings and/or specify the locations of other programs.

           Any conflicts or new values will be highlighted by the configure
           process in red. Once you are happy with all the settings and there are no
           more values in red, click the Generate button to produce the appropriate
           build files.

           On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio generator, the solution and
           project files will be created in the build folder.

           On linux, if you are using the Unix Makefiles generator, the Makefiles will
           be created in the build folder.

      2.2  Preferred command line example on Windows in c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\build directory:

               cmake -C ../config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" "-Ax64" \
               -DHDF5_ENABLE_SZIP_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF -DHDF5_ENABLE_ZLIB_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF \
               -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..

      2.3  On Windows, if you are using a Visual Studio Express version you must
           be sure that the following two options are correctly set/unset:

           HDF5_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON
           HDF5_USE_FOLDERS:BOOL=OFF

   3. Build HDF5

      On Windows, you can build HDF5 using either the Visual Studio Environment
      or the command line. The command line can be used on all platforms;
      Windows, linux, Unix, and Mac.

      To build from the command line, navigate to your build directory and
      execute the following:

              cmake --build . --config {Debug | Release}

      NOTE: "--config {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release on Windows.

      3.1  If you wish to use the Visual Studio environment, open the solution
           file in your build directory. Be sure to select either Debug or
           Release and build the solution.

      3.2.1  The external libraries (zlib, szip and plugins) can be configured
           to allow building the libraries by downloading from a GIT repository.
           The option is 'HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT'; by adding the following
           configuration option:
               -DHDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="GIT"

           The options to control the GIT parameters (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake file) are:
               ZLIB_GIT_URL:STRING="https://${git_url}/zlib"
               ZLIB_GIT_BRANCH="${git_branch}"
               SZIP_GIT_URL:STRING="https://${git_url}/szip"
               SZIP_GIT_BRANCH="${git_branch}"
               LIBAEC_GIT_URL:STRING="https://${git_url}/libaec"
               LIBAEC_GIT_BRANCH="${git_branch}"
               PLUGIN_GIT_URL:STRING="https://${git_url}/plugin"
               PLUGIN_GIT_BRANCH="${git_branch}"
           ${git_url} should be changed to your location and ${git_branch} is
           your branch in the repository. Also define CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
           to be the configuration type.

      3.2.2  Or the external libraries (zlib, szip and plugins) can be configured
           to allow building the libraries by using a compressed file.
           The option is 'HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT' and is enabled by
           adding the following configuration option:
               -DHDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT:STRING="TGZ"

           The options to control the TGZ URL (config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake
           file) are:
               ZLIB_TGZ_NAME:STRING="zlib_src.ext"
               LIBAEC_TGZ_NAME:STRING="libaec_src.ext"
               PLUGIN_TGZ_NAME:STRING="plugin_src.ext"
               TGZPATH:STRING="some_location"
            where "some_location/xxxx_src.ext" is the URL or full path to
            the compressed file and where ext is the type of the compression
            file such as .bz2, .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, or .zip. Also define
            CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to be the configuration type.

           NOTE: the file named by LIBAEC_TGZ_NAME is used to build SZIP.

   4. Test HDF5

      To test the build, navigate to your build directory and execute:

              ctest . -C {Debug | Release}

      NOTE: "-C {Debug | Release}" may be optional on your platform. We
            recommend choosing either Debug or Release to match the build
            step on Windows.

   5. Packaging HDF5 (create an install image)

      To package the build into a simple installer using WiX toolset or the NullSoft installer NSIS
      on Windows, or into compressed files (.tar.gz, .sh, .zip), use the CPack tool.

      To package the build, navigate to your build directory and execute;

              cpack -C {Debug | Release} CPackConfig.cmake

      NOTE: See note 8 of this document for NSIS information.
            See note 9 of this document for WiX information.
            Also, if you are using a Visual Studio Express version or
            want to disable the packaging components, set HDF5_NO_PACKAGES
            to ON (on the command line add -DHDF5_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON)

   6. The files that support building HDF5 with CMake are all the files in the
      config/cmake folder, the CMakeLists.txt files in each source folder, and
      CTestConfig.cmake. CTestConfig.cmake is specific to the internal testing
      performed by The HDF Group. It should be altered for the user's
      installation and needs. The cacheinit.cmake file settings are used by
      The HDF Group for daily testing. It should be altered/ignored for the user's
      installation and needs.

   7. More information about using CMake can be found at the Kitware site,
         www.cmake.org.

   8. Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
      The Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) is an open source installation
      system. It was created by the WinAmp authors to distribute that application,
      but it is now a general-purpose system which anyone might use. NSIS installers
      recognize /S for silent installation and /D=dir to specify the
      "output directory", which is where the program will be installed. These
      options are case-sensitive, so be sure to type them in upper case.

   9. WiX Toolset
      WiX--the Windows Installer XML toolset--lets developers create installers for
      Windows Installer, the Windows installation engine. See http://wixtoolset.org.

   10. Backward compatibility
        The 2.0.0 version of the HDF5 library can be configured to
        set all versioned functions to the version that was available in one of these HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSIONs
            HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v114
            HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v112
            HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v110
            HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v18
            HDF5_DEFAULT_API_VERSION:STRING=v16
        This allows existing code to be compiled with the
        v2.0 library without requiring immediate changes to the application
        source code.

        Note that because 2.0.0 is a major release, as long as the existing application
        code doesn't use symbols removed in 2.0.0, the code can be compiled and run with
        the new library.

        For additional configuration options and other details,
        see "API Compatibility Macros":
            https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/api-compat-macros.html

   11. Building doxygen
        One can optionally build the doxygen files for the HDF5 C library.
        By default, this option is disabled. To build the html files, specify
        'HDF5_BUILD_DOC'.

        cmake -G "<generator>" -DHDF5_BUILD_DOC:BOOL=ON  <sourcepath>

        Configuration will halt if the required applications are not available.
        To build:

              cmake --build . --config {Debug | Release}
        or
              make doxygen

   12. Parallel versus serial library
        The HDF5 library can be configured to use MPI and MPI-IO for
        parallelism on a distributed multi-processor system.  Read the
        file README_HPC.md for detailed information.
            HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL:BOOL=ON

        The threadsafe, C++ and Java interfaces are not compatible
        with the parallel option.
        Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been specified on the configure line,
        the following options must be disabled:
            HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

   13. Threadsafe capability
        The HDF5 library can be configured to be thread-safe (on a very
        large scale) with the HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE flag to the configure
        script. For further information, see the "Technical Notes" category
        in the documentation:
           https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/

        The high-level, C++, Fortran and Java interfaces are not compatible
        with the thread-safety option because the lock is not hoisted
        into the higher-level API calls.
        Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been specified on the configure line,
        the following options must be disabled:
            HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

  HDF5 Java bindings support two native interface implementations:
  - JNI (Java Native Interface): Default, works with Java 8+, production-stable
  - FFM (Foreign Function & Memory): Optional, requires Java 25+, modern native access

  Maven Artifacts:
  - org.hdfgroup:hdf5-java-ffm - FFM implementation
  - org.hdfgroup:hdf5-java-jni - JNI implementation

  Both implementations use the same hdf.hdf5lib.* package structure for seamless migration.

  To build HDF5 with Maven deployment support:
  cmake -DHDF5_BUILD_JAVA:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_ENABLE_MAVEN_DEPLOY:BOOL=ON ../hdf5

  To build Maven snapshot versions for development:
  cmake -DHDF5_BUILD_JAVA:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_ENABLE_MAVEN_DEPLOY:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_MAVEN_SNAPSHOT:BOOL=ON ../hdf5

  Note: FFM is selected for Java 25+ if HDF5_ENABLE_JNI is OFF, JNI for older versions.
  To force JNI even with Java 25+:
  cmake -DHDF5_BUILD_JAVA:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_ENABLE_MAVEN_DEPLOY:BOOL=ON -DHDF5_ENABLE_JNI:BOOL=ON ../hdf5

  Or use the Maven-enabled CMake presets (recommended):

  # Minimal build for Java artifacts only (recommended for Maven deployment)
  # Linux (GCC) - JNI (default, Java 8+):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven --fresh          # JNI Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-Snapshot --fresh # JNI Snapshot

  # Linux (GCC) - FFM (optional, Java 25+):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-FFM --fresh          # FFM Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-FFM-Snapshot --fresh # FFM Snapshot

  # Windows (MSVC) - JNI (default):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-MSVC-Maven --fresh          # JNI Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-MSVC-Maven-Snapshot --fresh # JNI Snapshot

  # Windows (MSVC) - FFM (optional):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-MSVC-Maven-FFM --fresh          # FFM Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-MSVC-Maven-FFM-Snapshot --fresh # FFM Snapshot

  # macOS (Clang) - JNI (default):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-Clang-Maven --fresh          # JNI Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-Clang-Maven-Snapshot --fresh # JNI Snapshot

  # macOS (Clang) - FFM (optional):
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-Clang-Maven-FFM --fresh         # FFM Release
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-Clang-Maven-FFM-Snapshot --fresh # FFM Snapshot

  # ROS3 VFD (S3 cloud storage) - Add to any preset above:
  cmake --workflow --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven --fresh -DHDF5_ENABLE_ROS3_VFD=ON

  Note: Presets are platform-specific. Use 'cmake --list-presets' to see
        available presets for your current platform.
  Note: Minimal Maven presets skip examples, testing, tools, C++, and Fortran
        builds to optimize for Java artifact generation only.

  Java Examples Maven Integration:
  The HDF5 Java examples are available as a separate Maven artifact:
  - org.hdfgroup:hdf5-java-examples
  - Platform-specific dependencies ensure compatibility with HDF5 Java library
  - Complete examples with documentation for all HDF5 Java functionality
  - See HDF5Examples/JAVA/README-MAVEN.md for usage instructions

  Testing Java Examples with Maven Artifacts:
  - Maven staging workflow validates examples against artifacts
  - Cross-platform testing ensures compatibility on all supported platforms
  - Native library error handling validates JAR structure in Maven-only environments
  - Fork-based testing allows validation on repository forks before canonical deployment
  - Dynamic repository workflows adapt to any GitHub repository automatically

NOTE:
  The BUILD_STATIC_EXECS ("Build Static Executables") option is only valid

  flag is not available on windows and some modern linux systems will
  ignore the flag.

NOTE:
  The HDF5_USE_GNU_DIRS option is usually recommended for linux platforms, but may
  be useful on other platforms. See the CMake documentation for more details.

  ---------------- Unsupported Library Options ---------------------
    The threadsafe, C++ and Java interfaces are not compatible
    with the HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL option.
    Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been specified,
    the following options must be disabled:
        HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

    The high-level, C++, Fortran and Java interfaces are not compatible
    with the HDF5_ENABLE_THREADSAFE option because the lock is not hoisted
    into the higher-level API calls.  Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been
    specified, the following options must be disabled:
       HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

    The multi-threaded concurrency and threadsafe options are mutually
    exclusive, only one or the other may be enabled.

    The multi-threaded concurrency, C++, and Java interfaces are not compatible
    with the HDF5_ENABLE_PARALLEL option.
    Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been specified,
    the following options must be disabled:
        HDF5_ENABLE_CONCURRENCY, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

    The high-level, C++, Fortran, and Java interfaces are not compatible
    with the HDF5_ENABLE_CONCURRENCY option because the lock is not hoisted
    into the higher-level API calls.  Unless HDF5_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED has been

       HDF5_BUILD_HL_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_CPP_LIB, HDF5_BUILD_FORTRAN, HDF5_BUILD_JAVA

========================================================================
VII. User Defined Options for HDF5 Libraries with CMake
========================================================================

Support for User Defined macros and options has been added. The file
UserMacros.cmake has an example of the technique.

Replace the template code with your macro in the UserMacros.cmake file.
Then enable the option to the CMake configuration, build and test process.


========================================================================
VIII. User Defined Compile Flags for HDF5 Libraries with CMake
========================================================================

Custom compiler flags can be added by defining the CMAKE_C_FLAGS and
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS variables.
Using a cmake script:
    set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -O2")
Defined on the configure line:
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2019" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-O2 ..

Debug symbols are enabled with configuration selections Debug or RelWithDebInfo.
The difference between Debug and RelWithDebInfo configurations is that
RelWithDebInfo optimizes the code similar to Release. It produces fully optimized
code, but also creates the symbol table and the debug metadata to give the
debugger input to map the execution back to the original code.
RelwithDebInfo configuration should not affect the performance when the code
is run without a debugger attached.

The HDF5_ENABLE_COVERAGE option will add "-g -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
to CMAKE_C_FLAGS.


========================================================================
IX:   Considerations for Cross-Compiling
========================================================================

Cross-compiling has several consequences for CMake:
    CMake cannot automatically detect the target platform.
    CMake cannot find libraries and headers in the default system directories.
    Executables built during cross compiling cannot be executed.

Cross-compiling support means that CMake separates information about the
build platform and target platform and gives the user mechanisms to solve
cross-compiling issues without additional requirements such as running
virtual machines, etc.

CMake uses a toolchain of utilities to compile, link libraries and create
archives, and other tasks to drive the build. The toolchain utilities
available are determined by the languages enabled.

CMake stores info about the current toolchain in the following variables:
    CMAKE_C_COMPILER,
    CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER.
They contain paths to the C and C++ compilers respectively. This is usually
enough on desktop platforms. In the case of embedded systems, a custom
linker and assembler setting may be needed. In more complex projects
you may need to additionally specify binaries to other parts of the toolchain
(size, ranlib, objcopy…). All these tools should be set in the corresponding
variables:
    CMAKE_AR,
    CMAKE_ASM_COMPILER,
    CMAKE_LINKER,
    CMAKE_OBJCOPY,
    CMAKE_RANLIB

As for the host and target operating systems, CMake stores their names in the
following variables:
    CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME – name of the platform, on which CMake is running (host platform).
        On major operating systems this is set to the Linux, Windows or
        Darwin (MacOS) value.
    CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME – name of the platform, for which we are building (target platform).
        By default, this value is the same as CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME, which
        means that we are building for the local platform (no cross-compilation).

Put the toolchain variables into a separate file (e.g. <toolchain_name>.cmake)
and set CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable to the path of that file.
If cmake is invoked with the command line parameter:
    --toolchain path/to/file
or
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/file
the file will be loaded early to set values for the compilers. The
CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable is set to true when CMake is cross-compiling.

Structure of the toolchain file
-------------------------------
In fact, the toolchain file doesn’t have any structure. You can put anything you
want there. But the best practice is to define at least these settings:
path to the toolchain binaries (C compiler, C++ compiler, linker, etc.)
name of the target platform (and optionally target processor architecture)
required compilation and linking flags on that particular platform
toolchain sysroot settings

It is recommended that you set the CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH variable to a path where
you have an exact copy of the root filesystem you have on your target device (with
libraries and binaries pre-compiled for the target processor).

XI. Creating Custom Preset Configurations
========================================================================

The quickest way to customize your build is to create a CMakeUserPresets.json file
in the HDF5 source directory.

Basic Customization Steps
--------------------------
1. Copy CMakePresets.json to CMakeUserPresets.json:
       cp CMakePresets.json CMakeUserPresets.json

2. Edit CMakeUserPresets.json:
   - Change configuration names from ci-* to my-*
   - Modify the "inherits" field in "configurePresets" for alternate options
   - Update "configurePreset" fields in "buildPresets", "testPresets", "packagePresets"
   - Update names in "workflowPresets" steps from ci-* to my-*

Example: Using Local Support Files
-----------------------------------
To change external support files to use a local directory:

{
  "name": "my-base-tgz",
  "hidden": true,
  "inherits": "ci-base",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "HDF5_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_SUPPORT": {"type": "STRING", "value": "TGZ"},
    "TGZPATH": {"type": "PATH", "value": "${sourceParentDir}/temp"}
  }
},
{
  "name": "my-StdCompression",
  "hidden": true,
  "inherits": "my-base-tgz",
  "cacheVariables": {
    ...
  }
},
{
  "name": "my-StdShar",
  "hidden": true,
  "inherits": "my-StdCompression",
  "cacheVariables": {
    ...
  }
},
{
  "name": "my-StdShar-GNUC",
  "description": "My Custom GNUC Standard Config for x64 (Release)",
  "inherits": [
    "ci-x64-Release-GNUC",
    "ci-CPP",
    "ci-Fortran",
    "ci-Java",
    "my-StdShar",
    "my-StdExamples"
  ]
}

Then you can change or add options for your specific case.

Maven Deployment Preset Example
--------------------------------
For Maven deployment with custom repository URL:

{
  "name": "my-maven-custom",
  "inherits": "ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-Snapshot",
  "cacheVariables": {
    "MAVEN_REPOSITORY_URL": {"type": "STRING", "value": "https://your-repo.com/maven"},
    "HDF5_ENABLE_ROS3_VFD": {"type": "BOOL", "value": "ON"}
  }
}

Then build with:
    cmake --workflow --preset my-maven-custom --fresh

Note: This example uses JNI (default). For FFM, inherit from ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven-FFM-Snapshot

Preset File Details
-------------------
CMakePresets.json and CMakeUserPresets.json:
  - Live in the project's root directory
  - Both have the same format
  - CMakePresets.json: Project-wide build details (don't modify)
  - CMakeUserPresets.json: Your local build customizations

The HDF Group presets require CMake 3.26 and use the Ninja build system.
Ninja may need to be installed separately on some platforms.

Hidden presets (marked "hidden": true) are used for inheritance and
cannot be used directly. They are defined in config/cmake-presets/hidden-presets.json.

========================================================================
XII. Using the Library
========================================================================
    For information on using HDF5 see the documentation, tutorials and examples
    found here:

       https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/index.html

    A summary of the features included in the built HDF5 installation can be found
    in the libhdf5.settings file in the same directory as the static and/or
    shared HDF5 libraries. However CMake provides a programmable method to
    determine the features of the library. The CMake installation will
    provide a CMake package configuration file, located in the installation folder,
    cmake/hdf5-config.cmake, and can be used to determine the features of the library.
    The file is accessed by using the find_package command in your CMakeLists.txt file.

   1. Set the HDF5_ROOT CMake variable, -DHDF5_ROOT=<install_path>
      or environment variable, set(ENV{HDF5_ROOT} "<install_path>")
      to the installed location of HDF5.
         On Windows:
            HDF5_ROOT=C:/Program Files/HDF_Group/HDF5/z.y.x/
         On unix:
            HDF5_ROOT=<install root folder>/HDF_Group/HDF5/z.y.x/

      If you are using shared libraries, you may need to add to the path
      environment variable. Set the path environment variable to the
      installed location of the library files for HDF5.
         On Windows (*.dll):
            PATH=%PATH%;C:/Program Files/HDF_Group/HDF5/z.y.x/bin
         On unix (*.so):
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<install root folder>/HDF_Group/HDF5/z.y.x/lib

      (Note there are no quote characters used on Windows and all platforms
      use forward slashes)

   2. Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt file:
        find_package (HDF5 NAMES hdf5 COMPONENTS  C shared)

      The components are optional and can be omitted if not needed. The
      components are: shared, static, C, CXX, Fortran, HL, Java, Tools, and VOL.



========================================================================
XIII. Using CMake Regex Options for Testing
========================================================================
   CMake provides a way to use regular expressions to control which tests are
   executed. The HDF5 CMake build system provides labels for each test that
   can be used to select tests. The labels are defined in the CMakeTests.cmake
   files.

   Some of the labels are:
   PARALLEL
     - MPI_TEST for parallel tests.
     - MPI_TEST_FORT for just parallel Fortran tests.
   SERIAL
     - CPP for C++ tests.
     - HL_CPP for high-level C++ tests.
     - FORTRAN for Fortran tests.
     - HL_FORTRAN for high-level Fortran tests.
     - HL for high-level tests.
     - JUnit for Java tests.
     - H5WATCH for tests that use the h5watch SWMR program.
     - SWMR for tests that use the SWMR feature.
     - h5_api for the API tests.
     - VOL for tests that use the VOL feature.
     - VFD for tests that use the VFD feature.
     - H5TEST for the library tests.
     - EX for examples
     - H5CLEAR for the h5clear tool tests.
     - H5COPY for the h5copy tool tests.
     - H5DIFF for the h5diff tool tests.
     - H5DUMP for the h5dump tool tests.
     - H5FC for the h5fc tool tests.
     - H5IMPORT for the h5import tool tests.
     - H5JAM for the h5jam tool tests.
     - H5LS for the h5ls tool tests.
     - H5MKGRP for the h5mkgrp tool tests.
     - H5REPACK for the h5repack tool tests.
     - H5REPART for the h5repart tool tests.
     - H5STAT for the h5stat tool tests.
     - PERFORM for performance tests.

    To run tests with a specific label, use the --tests-regex (or -R) option with ctest.
    For example, to run only the C++ tests, use:
        ctest . --tests-regex "CPP"

    To run tests with multiple labels, use the | operator to separate the labels.
    To run tests with the MPI_TEST and FORTRAN labels, use:
        ctest . --tests-regex "MPI_TEST|FORTRAN"

    To run tests and exclude tests with a specific label, use the
    --exclude-regex (or -E) option with ctest.

    For more information on using regular expressions with ctest,
    see the CMake documentation:
        https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ctest.1.html#regular-expressions



========================================================================
XIV. Java FFM Testing
========================================================================

HDF5 2.0 includes comprehensive Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) API tests
for Java 25+.

FFM Test Organization
---------------------
Tests are organized by HDF5 module in java/jtest/:

Module Test Files:
  - TestH5ffm.java     - General library operations
                         H5open, H5close, memory management, version info
  - TestH5Affm.java    - Attribute operations
  - TestH5Dffm.java    - Dataset operations
  - TestH5Effm.java    - Error handling
  - TestH5Fffm.java    - File operations
  - TestH5FDffm.java   - File drivers
  - TestH5Gffm.java    - Group operations
  - TestH5Iffm.java    - Identifier management
  - TestH5Lffm.java    - Link operations
  - TestH5Offm.java    - Object operations
  - TestH5Pffm.java    - Property lists
  - TestH5PLffm.java   - Plugin management
  - TestH5Rffm.java    - References
  - TestH5Sffm.java    - Dataspace operations
  - TestH5Tffm.java    - Datatype operations
  - TestH5VLffm.java   - VOL connector
  - TestH5Zffm.java    - Filter operations

Running FFM Tests
-----------------
To run all FFM tests:
    ctest -R "JUnitFFM" -V

To run specific module tests:
    ctest -R "JUnit-TestH5Affm" -V    # Attributes
    ctest -R "JUnit-TestH5Pffm" -V    # Properties
    ctest -R "JUnit-TestH5Tffm" -V    # Datatypes
    ctest -R "JUnit-TestH5Sffm" -V    # Dataspaces

Test Requirements:
  - Java 25+ with --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED
  - FFM bindings JAR (javahdf5-*.jar)
  - JUnit 4.x test framework
  - HDF5 native libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH

FFM Test Patterns:
  - All tests use Arena.ofConfined() for memory management
  - Proper cleanup in try-with-resources blocks
  - Return value checking with isSuccess() / isValidId()
  - See java/jtest/FfmTestSupport.java for utility methods

ROS3 VFD (S3 Cloud Storage):
  - Tests are compatible with both plain and ROS3-enabled builds
  - Use -DHDF5_ENABLE_ROS3_VFD=ON with any Maven preset for ROS3 builds
  - Example: cmake --preset ci-MinShar-GNUC-Maven -DHDF5_ENABLE_ROS3_VFD=ON
  - Same test suite validates both feature sets
