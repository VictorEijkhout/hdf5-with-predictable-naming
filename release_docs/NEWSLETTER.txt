HDF5 version 1.14.6 released on 2025-02-05

This is a maintenance release with a few changes and updates:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Reverted a change to the library's handling of UTF-8 file names. A change was
  made in the HDF5 1.14.4 release to address some issues with the library's
  handling of code pages and file paths on Windows. This change introduced
  other issues with handling UTF-8 file names that caused breakage for software
  using the 1.14.4 and 1.14.5 releases of HDF5.

  The change has been reverted for this release and will be addressed
  differently in a future release.

  If you use 1.14.4 or 1.14.5 and are happy with how UTF-8 file names are
  handled in those versions, do not update to 1.14.6. 

* Updated CMake find_package(ZLIB) defaults to find most system zlib installs.
