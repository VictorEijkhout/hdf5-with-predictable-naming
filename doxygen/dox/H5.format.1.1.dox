The format of an HDF5 file on disk encompasses several key ideas of the HDF4 and AIO file formats as well
as addressing some shortcomings therein. The new format is more self-describing than the HDF4 format and
is more uniformly applied to data objects in the file.

An HDF5 file appears to the user as a directed graph. The nodes of this graph are the higher-level HDF5
objects that are exposed by the HDF5 APIs:
\li Groups
\li Datasets
\li Named datatypes

At the lowest level, as information is actually written to the disk, an HDF5 file is made up of the
following objects:
\li A super block
\li B-tree nodes (containing either symbol nodes or raw data chunks)
\li Object headers
\li A global heap
\li Local heaps
\li Free space

The HDF5 library uses these lower-level objects to represent the higher-level objects that are then
presented to the user or to applications through the APIs. For instance, a group is an object header that
contains a message that points to a local heap and to a B-tree which points to symbol nodes. A dataset is
an object header that contains messages that describe datatype, space, layout, filters, external files,
fill value, etc with the layout message pointing to either a raw data chunk or to a B-tree that points to
raw data chunks.

\subsection subsec_fmt11_intro_doc This Document
This document describes the lower-level data objects; the higher-level objects and their properties are
described in the \ref UG.

Three levels of information comprise the file format. Level 0 contains basic information for identifying
and defining information about the file. Level 1 information contains the information about the pieces of a
file shared by many objects in the file (such as a B-trees and heaps). Level 2 is the rest of the file and
contains all of the data objects, with each object partitioned into header information, also known as
<em>metadata</em>, and data.

The sizes of various fields in the following layout tables are determined by looking at the number of
columns the field spans in the table. There are three exceptions: (1) The size may be overridden by
specifying a size in parentheses, (2) the size of addresses is determined by the <em>Size of Offsets</em>
field in the super block and is indicated in this document with a superscripted 'O', and (3) the size of
length fields is determined by the <em>Size of Lengths</em> field in the super block and is indicated
in this document with a superscripted 'L'.

Values for all fields in this document should be treated as unsigned integers, unless otherwise noted in
the description of a field. Additionally, all metadata fields are stored in little-endian byte order.

\section sec_fmt11_meta Disk Format: Level 0 - File Metadata

\subsection subsec_fmt11_boot_super Disk Format: Level 0A - File Signature and Super Block
The super block may begin at certain predefined offsets within the HDF5 file, allowing a block of
unspecified content for users to place additional information at the beginning (and end) of the HDF5 file
without limiting the HDF5 library's ability to manage the objects within the file itself. This feature was
designed to accommodate wrapping an HDF5 file in another file format or adding descriptive information to
the file without requiring the modification of the actual file's information. The super block is located by
searching for the HDF5 file signature at byte offset 0, byte offset 512 and at successive locations in the
file, each a multiple of two of the previous location, i.e. 0, 512, 1024, 2048, etc.

The super block is composed of a file signature, followed by super block and group version numbers,
information about the sizes of offset and length values used to describe items within the file, the size of
each group page, and a group entry for the root object in the file.

    This signature both identifies the file as an HDF5 file and provides for immediate detection of common
    file-transfer problems. The first two bytes distinguish HDF5 files on systems that expect the first two
    bytes to identify the file type uniquely. The first byte is chosen as a non-ASCII value to reduce the
    probability that a text file may be misrecognized as an HDF5 file; also, it catches bad file transfers
    that clear bit 7. Bytes two through four name the format. The CR-LF sequence catches bad file transfers
    that alter newline sequences. The control-Z character stops file display under MS-DOS. The final line
    feed checks for the inverse of the CR-LF translation problem. (This is a direct descendent of the
    <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Rationale.html#R.PNG-file-signature">PNG</a>

\section sec_fmt11_infra Disk Format: Level 1 - File Infrastructure

\subsection subsec_fmt11_infra_btrees Disk Format: Level 1A - B-link Trees and B-tree Nodes
B-link trees allow flexible storage for objects which tend to grow in ways that cause the object to be stored
discontiguously. B-trees are described in various algorithms books including "Introduction to Algorithms" by
Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, and Ronald L. Rivest. The B-link tree, in which the sibling nodes at
a particular level in the tree are stored in a doubly-linked list, is described in the "Efficient Locking
for Concurrent Operations on B-trees" paper by Phillip Lehman and S. Bing Yao as published in the <cite>ACM
Transactions on Database Systems</cite>, Vol. 6, No. 4, December 1981.

The B-link trees implemented by the file format contain one more key than the number of children. In other
words, each child pointer out of a B-tree node has a left key and a right key. The pointers out of internal
nodes point to sub-trees while the pointers out of leaf nodes point to symbol nodes and raw data chunks.
Aside from that difference, internal nodes and leaf nodes are identical.

  <td>key[<i>N</i>]</td>
</tr>
</table>
where child[<i>i</i>] is a pointer to a sub-tree (at a level above Level 0) or to data (at Level 0).
Each key[<i>i</i>] describes an <i>item</i> stored by the B-tree (a chunk or an object of a group node).
The range of values represented by child[<i>i</i>] is indicated by key[<i>i</i>] and key[<i>i</i>+1].

The following question must next be answered: &ldquo;Is the value described by key[<i>i</i>] contained in
child[<i>i</i>-1] or in child[<i>i</i>]?&rdquo; The answer depends on the type of tree. In trees for groups (node
type 0) the object described by key[<i>i</i>] is the greatest object contained in child[<i>i</i>-1] while
in chunk trees (node type 1) the chunk described by key[<i>i</i>] is the least chunk in child[<i>i</i>].

That means that key[0] for group trees is sometimes unused; it points to offset zero in the heap, which is
always the empty string and compares as "less-than" any valid object name.

And key[<i>N</i>] for chunk trees is sometimes unused; it contains a chunk offset which compares as
"greater-than" any other chunk offset and has a chunk byte size of zero to indicate that it is not actually
allocated.

\subsection subsec_fmt11_infra_symboltable Disk Format: Level 1B - Group and Symbol Nodes
A group is an object internal to the file that allows arbitrary nesting of objects within the file (including
other groups). A group maps a set of names in the group to a set of relative file addresses where objects with
those names are located in the file. Certain metadata for an object to which the group points can be cached in
the group's symbol table in addition to the object's header.

An HDF5 object name space can be stored hierarchically by partitioning the name into components and storing
each component in a group. The group entry for a non-ultimate component points to the group containing the
next component. The group entry for the last component points to the object being named.

A group is a collection of group nodes pointed to by a B-link tree. Each group node contains entries for one
or more symbols. If an attempt is made to add a symbol to an already full group node containing 2<em>K</em>
entries, then the node is split and one node contains <em>K</em> symbols and the other contains <em>K</em>+1
symbols.

\subsection subsec_fmt11_infra_globalheap Disk Format: Level 1E - Global Heap
Each HDF5 file has a global heap which stores various types of information which is typically shared between
datasets. The global heap was designed to satisfy these goals:
<ol type="A">
  <li>Repeated access to a heap object must be efficient without resulting in repeated file I/O requests.
      Since global heap objects will typically be shared among several datasets, it is probable that the
      object will be accessed repeatedly.</li>
  <li>Collections of related global heap objects should result in fewer and larger I/O requests. For
      instance, a dataset of object references will have a global heap object for each reference. Reading
      the entire set of object references should result in a few large I/O requests instead of one small
      I/O request for each reference.</li>
  <li>It should be possible to remove objects from the global heap and the resulting file hole should be
      eligible to be reclaimed for other uses.</li>
</ol>

The implementation of the heap makes use of the memory management already available at the file level and
combines that with a new top-level object called a <em>collection</em> to achieve Goal B. The global heap is
the set of all collections. Each global heap object belongs to exactly one collection and each collection
contains one or more global heap objects. For the purposes of disk I/O and caching, a collection is treated
as an atomic object.

The HDF5 library creates global heap collections as needed, so there may be multiple collections throughout
the file. The set of all of them is abstractly called the "global heap", although they don't actually link
to each other, and there is no global place in the file where you can discover all of the collections. The
collections are found simply by finding a reference to one through another object in the file (eg.
variable-length datatype elements, etc).

\subsection subsec_fmt11_infra_freespaceindex Disk Format: Level 1F - Free-space Index
The free-space index is a collection of blocks of data, dispersed throughout the file, which are currently
not used by any file objects.

The super block contains a pointer to root of the free-space description; that pointer is currently required
to be the @ref FMT11UndefinedAddress "undefined address".

The format of the free-space index is not defined at this time.

\section sec_fmt11_dataobject Disk Format: Level 2 - Data Objects
Data objects contain the real information in the file. These objects compose the scientific data and other
information which are generally thought of as "data" by the end-user. All the other information in the file
is provided as a framework for these data objects.

A data object is composed of header information and data information. The header information contains the
information needed to interpret the data information for the data object as well as additional "meta-data"
or pointers to additional "meta-data" used to describe or annotate each data object.

\subsection subsec_fmt11_dataobject_hdr Disk Format: Level 2A - Data Object Headers
The header information of an object is designed to encompass all the information about an object, except for
the data itself. This information includes the dataspace, datatype, information about how the data is stored
on disk (in external files, compressed, broken up in blocks, etc.), as well as other information used by the
library to speed up access to the data objects or maintain a file's integrity. Information stored by user
applications as attributes is also stored in the object's header. The header of each object is not necessarily
located immediately prior to the object's data in the file and in fact may be located in any position in the
file. The order of the messages in an object header is not significant.

Header messages are aligned on 8-byte boundaries.

The header message types and the message data associated with them compose the critical "meta-data" about
each object. Some header messages are required for each object while others are optional. Some optional
header messages may also be repeated several times in the header itself, the requirements and number of
times allowed in the header will be noted in each header message description below.

The following is a list of currently defined header messages:

\subsubsection subsubsec_fmt11_dataobject_hdr_nil Name: NIL
<strong>Header Message Type: </strong>0x0000

<strong>Length:</strong> varies

<strong>Status:</strong> Optional, may be repeated.

<strong>Purpose and Description:</strong> The NIL message is used to indicate a message which is to be ignored
when reading the header messages for a data object. [Possibly one which has been deleted for some reason.]

<strong>Format of Data:</strong> Unspecified.<br />

\subsubsection subsubsec_fmt11_dataobject_hdr_simple Name: Simple Dataspace
<strong>Header Message Type: </strong>0x0001

<strong>Length:</strong> Varies according to the number of dimensions, as described in the following table

<strong>Status:</strong> Required for dataset objects, may not be repeated.

<strong>Description:</strong>The simple dataspace message describes the number of dimensions (i.e. "rank")
and size of each dimension that the data object has. This message is only used for datasets which have a
simple, rectilinear grid layout; datasets requiring a more complex layout (irregularly structured or
unstructured grids, etc.) must use the <em>Complex Dataspace</em> message for expressing the space the
dataset inhabits. <i>(Note: The <em>Complex Dataspace</em> functionality is not yet implemented (and it is
not described in this document.)</i>

<strong>Header Message Type:</strong> 0x0003<br />
<strong>Length:</strong> variable<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Required for dataset or named datatype objects, may not be repeated.<br />

<strong>Description:</strong> The datatype message defines the datatype for each element of a dataset. A
datatype can describe an atomic type like a fixed- or floating-point type or a compound type like a C
struct. Datatypes are stored as a list of datatype classes and their associated properties.

Datatype messages that are part of a dataset object, do not describe how elements are related to one
another, the dataspace message is used for that purpose. Datatype messages that are part of a named
datatype message describe an "abstract" datatype that can be used by other objects in the file.

The Properties field of a compound datatype is a list of the member definitions of the compound datatype.
The member definitions appear one after another with no intervening bytes. The member types are described
with a recursive datatype message.

Note that the property descriptions are different for different versions of the datatype version. Additionally
note that the version 0 properties are deprecated and have been replaced with the version 1 properties in
versions of the HDF5 library from the 1.4 release onward.

There are no bit fields defined for the array class.

Note that the dimension information defined in the property for this datatype class is independent of
dataspace information for a dataset. The dimension information here describes the dimensionality of the
information within a data element (or a component of an element, if the array datatype is nested within
another datatype) and the dataspace for a dataset describes the location of the elements in a dataset.

<strong>Header Message Type:</strong> 0x0004<br />
<strong>Length:</strong> varies<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Optional, may not be repeated.<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The fill value message stores a single data point value which is returned
to the application when an uninitialized data point is read from the dataset. The fill value is interpreted
with the same datatype as the dataset. If no fill value message is present then a fill value of all zero is assumed.

This fill value message is deprecated in favor of the "new" fill value message (Message Type 0x0005) and
is only written to the file for forward compatibility with versions of the HDF5 library before the 1.6.0
version. Additionally, it only appears for datasets with a user defined fill value (as opposed to the library
default fill value or an explicitly set "undefined" fill value).

\subsubsection subsubsec_fmt11_dataobject_hdr_layout Name: Data Storage - Layout
<strong>Header Message Type:</strong> 0x0008<br />
<strong>Length:</strong> varies<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Required for datasets, may not be repeated.

<strong>Purpose and Description:</strong> Data layout describes how the elements of a multi-dimensional array
are arranged in the linear address space of the file. Three types of data layout are supported:
<ol>
  <li>Contiguous: The array can be stored in one contiguous area of the file. The layout requires that the
      size of the array be constant and does not permit chunking, compression, checksums, encryption, etc.
      The message stores the total size of the array and the offset of an element from the beginning of the
      storage area is computed as in C.</li>
  <li>Chunked: The array domain can be regularly decomposed into chunks and each chunk is allocated separately.
      This layout supports arbitrary element traversals, compression, encryption, and checksums, and the chunks
      can be distributed across external raw data files (these features are described in other messages).
      The message stores the size of a chunk instead of the size of the entire array; the size of the entire
      array can be calculated by traversing the B-tree that stores the chunk addresses.</li>
  <li>Compact: The array can be stored in one contiguous block, as part of this object header message (this is
      called "compact" storage below).</li>
</ol>

\subsubsection subsubsec_fmt11_dataobject_hdr_attribute Name: Attribute
<strong>Header Message Type:</strong> 0x000C<br />
<strong>Length:</strong> varies<br />
<strong>Status:</strong> Optional, may be repeated.<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> The <em>Attribute</em> message is used to list objects in the HDF
file which are used as attributes, or "meta-data" about the current object. An attribute is a small dataset;
it has a name, a datatype, a data space, and raw data. Since attributes are stored in the object header they
must be relatively small (<64KB) and can be associated with any type of object which has an object header
(groups, datasets, named types and spaces, etc.).

Note: Attributes on an object must have unique names. (The HDF5 library currently enforces this by causing
the creation of an attribute with a duplicate name to fail). Attributes on different objects may have the
same name, however.

\subsection subsec_fmt11_dataobject_storage Disk Format: Level 2b - Data Object Data Storage
The data for an object is stored separately from the header information in the file and may not actually
be located in the HDF5 file itself if the header indicates that the data is stored externally. The
information for each record in the object is stored according to the dimensionality of the object
(indicated in the dimensionality header message). Multi-dimensional data is stored in C order [same
as current scheme], i.e. the "last" dimension changes fastest.

Data whose elements are composed of simple number-types are stored in native-endian IEEE format, unless
they are specifically defined as being stored in a different machine format with the architecture-type
information from the number-type header message. This means that each architecture will need to
[potentially] byte-swap data values into the internal representation for that particular machine.

Data with a variable-length datatype is stored in the global heap of the HDF5 file. Global heap
identifiers are stored in the data object storage.

Data whose elements are composed of pointer number-types are stored in several different ways depending
on the particular pointer type involved. Simple pointers are just stored as the dataset offset of the
object being pointed to with the size of the pointer being the same number of bytes as offsets in the file.
Dataset region references are stored as a heap-ID which points to the following information within the
file-heap: an offset of the object pointed to, number-type information (same format as header message),
dimensionality information (same format as header message), sub-set start and end information (i.e. a
coordinate location for each), and field start and end names (i.e.  a [pointer to the] string indicating
the first field included and a [pointer to the] string name for the last field).

Data of a compound datatype is stored as a contiguous stream of the items in the structure, with each
item formatted according to its datatype.
