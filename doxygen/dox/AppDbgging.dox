\section sec_adddbg_intro Introduction
The HDF5 library contains a number of debugging features to make programmers' lives
easier including the ability to print detailed error messages, check invariant
conditions, display timings and other statistics.

\subsection subsec_adddbg_intro_err Error Messages
Error messages are normally displayed automatically on the standard error stream and
include a stack trace of the library including file names, line numbers, and function
names. The application has complete control over how error messages are displayed and
can disable the display on a permanent or temporary basis. Refer to the documentation
 for the H5E error handling package.

\subsection subsec_adddbg_intro_invar Invariant Conditions
Unless NDEBUG is defined during compiling, the library will include code to verify that
invariant conditions have the expected values. When a problem is detected the library will
display the file and line number within the library and the invariant condition that
failed. A core dump may be generated for post mortem debugging. The code to perform these
checks can be included on a per-package bases.

\subsection subsec_adddbg_intro_stats Timings and Statistics
The library can be configured to accumulate certain statistics about things like cache
performance, datatype conversion, data space conversion, and data filters. The code is
included on a per-package basis and enabled at runtime by an environment variable.

\subsection subsec_adddbg_intro_trace API Tracing
Tracing API calls has been removed from the library.

The statistics can be displayed on any output stream (including streams opened by
the shell) with output from different packages even going to different streams.

\section sec_adddbg_msg Error Messages
By default any API function that fails will print an error stack to the standard error stream.
\code
HDF5-DIAG: Error detected in thread 0.  Back trace follows.
  #000: H5F.c line 1245 in H5Fopen(): unable to open file
    major(04): File interface
    minor(10): Unable to open file
  #001: H5F.c line 846 in H5F_open(): file does not exist
    major(04): File interface
    minor(10): Unable to open file
\endcode
The error handling package (H5E) is described elsewhere.

\section sec_adddbg_invars Invariant Conditions
To include checks for invariant conditions the library should be configured
with --disable-production, the default for versions before 1.2. The library
designers have made every attempt to handle error conditions gracefully but
an invariant condition assertion may fail in certain cases. The output from
a failure usually looks something like this:
\code
Assertion failed: H5.c:123: i<NELMTS(H5_debug_g)
IOT Trap, core dumped.
\endcode

\section sec_adddbg_stats Timings and Statistics
Code to accumulate statistics is included at compile time by using the --enable-debug
configure switch. The switch can be followed by an equal sign and a comma-separated
list of package names or else a default list is used.
<table>
<tr>
<th><strong>Name</strong>
</th>
<th><strong>Default</strong>
</th>
<th><strong>Description</strong>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>a</td><td>No</td><td>Attributes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ac</td><td>Yes</td><td>Meta data cache</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td><td>Yes</td><td>B-Trees</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d</td><td>Yes</td><td>Datasets</td>

<td>g</td><td>Yes</td><td>Groups</td>

<tr>
<td>hg</td><td>Yes</td><td>Global heap</td>

<tr>
<td>hl</td><td>No</td><td>Local heaps</td>

<tr>
<td>i</td><td>Yes</td><td>Interface abstraction</td>

<td>mf</td><td>No</td><td>File memory management</td>

<td>mm</td><td>Yes</td><td>Library memory management</td>

<td>o</td><td>No</td><td>Object headers and messages</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>t</td><td>Yes</td><td>Datatypes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>v</td><td>Yes</td><td>Vectors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>z</td><td>Yes</td><td>Raw data filters</td>
</tr>
</table>

In addition to including the code at compile time the application must enable each package at
runtime. This is done by listing the package names in the HDF5_DEBUG environment variable. That
variable may also contain file descriptor numbers (the default is '2') which control the output
for all following packages up to the next file number. The word 'all' refers to all packages. Any
word my be preceded by a minus sign to turn debugging off for the package.

\subsection subsec_adddbg_stats_sample Sample debug specifications
<table>
<tr>
<td>all
</td>
<td>This causes debugging output from all packages to be sent to the standard error stream.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>all -t -s
</td>
<td>Debugging output for all packages except datatypes and data spaces will appear on the standard error stream.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-all ac 255 t,s
</td>
<td>This disables all debugging even if the default was to debug something, then output
from the meta data cache is send to the standard error stream and output from data types
and spaces is sent to file descriptor 255 which should be redirected by the shell.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The components of the HDF5_DEBUG value may be separated by any non-lowercase letter.
